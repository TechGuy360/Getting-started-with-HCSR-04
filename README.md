# Getting-started-with-HCSR-04
This is the arduino code file which you have to run on your arduino . And please follow the pinup chart with arduino and HCSR-04 module . 
And please be careful while connecting the (ECHO and TRIG) pins of the hcsr04 to arduino . 
Connect the same pin of hcsr04 to any of the arduino versions. 
After this video i will make a distance measuring device by using Arduino.  THANKS FOR WATCHING
